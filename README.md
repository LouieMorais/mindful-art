## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1. Purpose

_Mindful Art_ is a digital platform that enables users to search, curate, and reflect upon artworks drawn from multiple museum and university collections. The project unifies open cultural data into a single, user-centred interface that supports both personal curation and mindful engagement with visual art.

<a href="#mindful-art---project-initiation-document---release-01-mvp" style="float: right; font-size: 0.8em; display: block; padding: 10px 0;  clear: both">**[BACK TO INDEX]**</a>

### 1.2. Background and Rationale

The project arises from the **Exhibition Curator Project Brief**, which tasks developers with creating a viewer-driven exhibition platform using at least two open institutional APIs. While the brief defines the technical and functional baseline, _Mindful Art_ extends the concept through an experience framework encouraging slow looking, emotional awareness, and contemplative engagement with art.

The rationale for _Mindful Art_ rests on three principles:

1. **Accessibility of knowledge:** democratise access to public art collections through open APIs.
2. **Mindful interaction:** design the interface to encourage focus and reflection rather than distraction.
3. **Curatorial empowerment:** enable users to act as their own curators, assembling temporary or permanent exhibitions that express personal or thematic intent.

<a href="#mindful-art---project-initiation-document---release-01-mvp" style="float: right; font-size: 0.8em; display: block; padding: 10px 0;  clear: both">**[BACK TO INDEX]**</a>

### 1.3. Business and Educational Context

_Mindful Art_ functions both as a software-engineering capstone and as a cultural-heritage prototype. It demonstrates how modern web development practices can serve curatorial and educational objectives. The project is relevant to:

- **Cultural institutions** seeking open-access engagement tools.
- **Educators** exploring digital-humanities applications.
- **Developers** examining full-stack integration of open cultural data.

### 1.5. Relationship to the Exhibition Curator Brief

The project fully adheres to the mandatory MVP criteria specified in the **Exhibition Curator Project Brief**:

- Searches and filters artworks across at least two open institutional APIs.
- Allows saving of artworks into a temporary collection.
- Enables creation of user-defined exhibitions persisting for the session.
- Displays images and metadata for each artwork.
- Communicates loading and error states clearly.

In addition, _Mindful Art_ introduces a **mindfulness-based design philosophy** that informs the tone, interface pacing, and visual hierarchy throughout the product.

## 3. Future Vision

### 3.1. Strategic Intent

While the R01 MVP establishes the platform’s core functionality, _Mindful Art_ is designed as an evolving system that merges cultural access with personal reflection. The long-term goal is to build a sustainable and scalable environment in which users engage with art mindfully and share that engagement with others. The Future Vision defines how the product will expand beyond functional discovery and curation towards reflective practice, community exchange, and institutional collaboration.

<a href="#mindful-art---project-initiation-document---release-01-mvp" style="float: right; font-size: 0.8em; display: block; padding: 10px 0;  clear: both">**[BACK TO INDEX]**</a>

### 3.2. Conceptual Expansion

The development path beyond the MVP will extend the platform across three main dimensions: reflection, collaboration, and partnership.

#### 3.2.1. Reflective Practice and Personal Growth

- Introduce guided reflection tools such as written journals, thematic prompts, and timed viewing modes that encourage deliberate observation and self-awareness.
- Support optional thematic journeys (for example, “Stillness”, “Identity”, or “Memory”) that organise artworks by emotional or conceptual resonance rather than institution.
- Provide a private reflective space within each user’s profile where notes and personal insights can be linked to artworks or Galleries.

<a href="#mindful-art---project-initiation-document---release-01-mvp" style="float: right; font-size: 0.8em; display: block; padding: 10px 0;  clear: both">**[BACK TO INDEX]**</a>

#### 3.2.2. Community and Sharing

- Allow users to publish selected Galleries publicly or share them privately with collaborators.
- Enable comments, annotations, or discussion threads within shared Galleries.
- Establish moderation and attribution rules to ensure respectful and educational exchange.
- Introduce optional discovery feeds where users can explore community-curated exhibitions.

<a href="#mindful-art---project-initiation-document---release-01-mvp" style="float: right; font-size: 0.8em; display: block; padding: 10px 0;  clear: both">**[BACK TO INDEX]**</a>

#### 3.2.3. Educational and Institutional Collaboration

- Offer collaborative tools for teachers, students, and researchers to create and discuss Galleries in a classroom or research context.
- Provide analytics dashboards for partner museums and universities to understand user engagement and popular themes.
- Enable co-curated or featured exhibitions prepared jointly with participating institutions.

<a href="#mindful-art---project-initiation-document---release-01-mvp" style="float: right; font-size: 0.8em; display: block; padding: 10px 0;  clear: both">**[BACK TO INDEX]**</a>

### 3.3. Technical and Architectural Direction

Subsequent releases will introduce architectural and performance enhancements to support these extensions:

- Scalable database structure for user reflections, comments, and collaborative data.
- Improved caching and API management to support larger institutional datasets.
- Integration of institutional analytics and data-sharing pipelines.
- Optional Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for offline use and cross-device continuity.
- Modular refactoring to separate functional layers such as search, curation, and reflection.

### 3.4. Research and Design Development

Ongoing research and design will focus on:

- Evaluating the cognitive and emotional impact of digital mindfulness in cultural engagement.
- Refining the visual identity and interaction design to support calm and sustained focus.
- Expanding accessibility standards to ensure usability for neurodiverse and sensory-impaired users.
- Collaborating with cultural partners on design principles for inclusive, reflective interfaces.

### 3.5. Long-Term Vision Statement

_Mindful Art_ envisions a digital ecosystem where public collections and personal awareness intersect. Users will not simply browse images but engage in an ongoing reflective dialogue with art, guided by calm technology and thoughtful design. Through community participation and institutional collaboration, _Mindful Art_ aims to promote slower, deeper, and more meaningful interaction with visual culture in the digital age.

## 7. Success Criteria / Definition of Done

### 7.1. Purpose

This section defines the measurable standards that determine whether the _Mindful Art R01 MVP_ satisfies its objectives. Each criterion corresponds directly to a functional or non-functional requirement from Sections 2. and 6, ensuring transparent traceability between specification and delivery.

<a href="#mindful-art---project-initiation-document---release-01-mvp" style="float: right; font-size: 0.8em; display: block; padding: 10px 0;  clear: both">**[BACK TO INDEX]**</a>

### 7.2. Functional Success Criteria

The MVP is considered functionally complete when all of the following are achieved:

1. **Authentication and Persistence:**
   Users can register or sign in through Google or Apple, and their profile data, Vault, and Galleries persist across sessions.
2. **Search and Retrieval:**
   Users can search artworks across at least two institutional APIs, view thumbnails and metadata, and filter results by institution.
3. **Vault Functionality:**
   Artworks can be stored in the Vault, viewed, removed, and saved to Galleries at any time.
4. **Gallery Management:**
   Users can create, edit, and delete Galleries. Artworks within a Gallery can be viewed sequentially with chained navigation.
5. **Artwork Display:**
   Artwork pages show a high-resolution image and metadata with adjustable zoom levels. Navigation returns users to the previous screen without resetting filters or position.
6. **Loading and Error Handling:**
   All asynchronous operations display clear loading indicators and user-friendly error messages, with retry options where appropriate.
7. **Responsive and Accessible Design:**
   The application is fully responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, and meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility.
8. **Data Security:**
   All user data are transmitted via HTTPS and stored in compliance with GDPR and UK data-protection legislation.
