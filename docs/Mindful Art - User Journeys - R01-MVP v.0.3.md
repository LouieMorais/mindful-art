##### 3.2.3.4. User Area / Your Art Vault

![3-2-3-4-b-User-Area-Your-Art-Vault-Page-With-Artwork.png](https://i.ibb.co/9H28YV0q/3-2-3-4-b-User-Area-Your-Art-Vault-Page-With-Artwork.png)

- Please be reminded that the Art Vault is not a gallery but a storage area for later viewing and works independently from galleries, as such:
  - Cards removed from the Vault (page or strap) do not get removed from any galleries.
  - Cards removed from galleries do not get removed from the Vault.
  - Cards inside the Vault are ordered by last-saved(in vault)-first-displayed
  - The Vault Strap strictly mirrors the order and contents of the Your Art Vault page, and vice-versa.
  - Cards are idempotent: they are either in or out of the Vault.
- Back button to **3.2.3.2. User Area > Your Galleries**
- How to use your art vault tutorial
  - **_State 1:_** With no artwork in Your Vault page - Vault tutorial expanded
  - **_State 2:_** With artwork in Your Vault page - Vault tutorial contracted to first paragraph

- Results are presented in the same format as Search Results without sorting for institutions and with the option for Art Vault options set for remove.
- **_Artwork Vault Card_** at [3.2.6.3. Artwork Vault Card](#3263-artwork-vault-card).

---

#### 3.2.4. Artwork Page

- Artwork Pages can be:
  - **Unchained Artwork Pages** - these are artwork pages that are called from outside a gallery, from places such as search results or Your Art Vault. They are called "unchained" because they are not linked in order to other artwork, as in a gallery.
  - **Chained Artwork Pages** - these are artwork pages that are called from inside a gallery page or strap. They are called "chained" because they are linked in order of appearance to other artworks in a gallery. For example, artwork 3 of a gallery with 12 pieces, will have artwork 4 as its next "chain" and artwork 2 as its previous - artwork 12 will be the last chain.
    - By default, the chained order is last-saved(in gallery)-first-displayed - MVP.
    - Chained artwork can be ordered by curators, if so, the order established by the curator is maintained until the last artwork present when the gallery was last re-ordered. New artwork saved after a gallery has been ordered is saved last: last-saved(in gallery)-last displayed - post-MVP.
  - The main visible difference is that a chained artwork page will show a previous and next artwork button and the artwork will be accompanied with its position (e.g. "4/25"), while unchained artworks link to nothing else and have no order position numbers.

<a href="#mindful-art---project-initiation-document---release-01-mvp" style="float: right; font-size: 0.8em; display: block; padding: 10px 0;  clear: both">**[BACK TO INDEX]**</a>

##### 3.2.4.1. Search Results | Your Art Vault Page | Your Art Vault Strap > Unchained Artwork Page

- a. Artwork set to 100% full screen width - it is ok if part of the artwork goes beyond the visible screen fold. Request the **closest provider rendition** to the current viewport/zoom (fall back to client scale if a rendition isn’t available). Target **≥1600px** width for 100% on desktop; preserve aspect ratio; no distortion, no height clipping.
- b. Back CTA to page where the artwork was linked from - if from a search results card, search is not resubmitted and session is not reset - results, states and statuses are maintained as left before the artwork page was loaded. Encode **query + selected institutions** in the URL; store **scroll position** in memory keyed by the URL. This gives correct Back/Forward behaviour and deep links without heavy URL fragments.
- c. Zoom Controls (25%, 50% and 100% screen widths)
- d. Name of the artwork
- e. Name of artist,
- f. Year of creation
- g. All other meta and informational data about the artwork.

##### 3.2.4.2. Gallery Page | Gallery Strap > Chained Artwork Page

- a. Artwork set to 100% full screen width - it is ok if part of the artwork goes beyond the visible screen fold. Request the **closest provider rendition** to the current viewport/zoom (fall back to client scale if a rendition isn’t available). Target **≥1600px** width for 100% on desktop; preserve aspect ratio; no distortion.
- b. Artwork order position in gallery - 3/36, 22/22, etc.
- c. Previous and Next Artwork CTA
- d. Back CTA to page where the artwork was linked from - session is not reset - results, states and statuses are maintained as left before the artwork page was loaded. Encode **query + selected institutions** in the URL; store **scroll position** in memory keyed by the URL. This gives correct Back/Forward behaviour and deep links without heavy URL fragments.
- e. Zoom Controls (25%, 50% and 100% screen widths)
- f. Name of the artwork
- g. Name of artist,
- h. Year of creation
- i. All other meta and informational data about the artwork.

#### 3.2.5. Straps

Straps work as stand-alone tasters of galleries hosting Artwork Cards or, as in the case of the Vault Strap, they work as a "basket" previewing items for later curation.

##### 3.2.5.1. Vault Strap

![3-2-5-1-Vault-Strap.png](https://i.ibb.co/YFYchDCv/3-2-5-1-Vault-Strap.png)

- Appears in the search/search results page whenever an Artwork Search Card is saved from the search results to the Art Vault.
- The Vault Strap lists Artwork Vault Strap Cards by order of last saved in the Vault first.
- The Vault Strap is persistent, meaning that it will always show up in the search/search results page, in all states (default/no-results/with-results), when it has contents added.
- Its position will be at the bottom of the viewing screen always before the fold: z-index at the highest above all other UI. **Temporary collapse/expand** control remembered in session storage so it doesn’t obstruct other UI
- Please be reminded that the Art Vault is not a gallery but a storage area and works independently from galleries, as such:
  - Cards removed from the Vault (page or strap) do not get removed from any galleries.
  - Cards removed from galleries do not get removed from the Vault.
  - Cards inside the Vault are ordered by last-saved(in vault)-first-displayed
  - The Vault Strap strictly mirrors the order and contents of the Your Art Vault page, and vice-versa.
  - Cards are idempotent: they are either in or out of the Vault.
- Artwork Vault Strap Cards in the Vault Strap are saved and persist across sessions, until the user removes the card. Artwork Vault Strap Cards are specified at **_[3.2.6.2. Artwork Vault Strap Card](#3262-artwork-vault-strap-card)_**.
- The Vault Strap has the following elements:
  - a. Title "Your Art Vault" linked to Your Art Vault page at **_[3.2.3.4. User Area / Your Art Vault](#3234-user-area--your-art-vault)_**.
  - b. Amount of artworks saved.
  - c. Collapse/Expand control.
  - ~~d. Forward (Next), Backward (Previous) controls~~ - post-MVP

##### 3.2.5.2. Gallery Straps

![3-2-5-2-Gallery-Straps.png](https://i.ibb.co/1fCjQ3Vm/3-2-5-2-Gallery-Straps.png)

- Appears in Your Galleries page - providing a taster of the galleries curated by users.
- The Gallery Strap lists Artwork Gallery Strap Cards strictly mirroring the artwork order in the individual gallery it is linked to:
  - By default, the chained order is last-saved(in gallery)-first-displayed - MVP.
  - Chained artwork can be ordered by curators, if so, the order established by the curator is maintained up to the last artwork present when the gallery was last re-ordered. New artwork saved after a gallery has been ordered is saved last: last-saved(in gallery)-last displayed - post-MVP.

- The saved order of artwork in a gallery is immutable unless the curator changes it.
- Artwork Gallery Strap Cards are specified at **_[3.2.6.4. Artwork Gallery Strap Card](#3264-artwork-gallery-strap-card)_**.
- The Gallery Strap has the following elements:
  - a. Name of the gallery linked to the individual gallery page, as in **_[3.2.3.3. User Area / Your Galleries / Gallery Page](#3233-user-area--your-galleries--gallery-page)_**.
  - b. Amount of artworks saved.
  - ~~c. Forward (Next), Backward (Previous) controls~~ - post-MVP

#### [3.2.7. Create Gallery Functionality](#327-create-gallery-functionality)

In Mindful Art, users can create galleries from several CTAs present throughout the service:

- Via the **More Actions (3 Dots) Menu** in **Artwork Cards:**
  - a. **Artwork Search Card -** in the artwork items listed in search results
  - b. **Artwork Vault Strap Card** - in the artwork items listed in the Art Vault Strap that appears in search results when the user sends artwork to the Vault
  - c. **Artwork Vault Card** - in the artwork items listed in Your Art Vault Page
  - d. **Artwork Gallery Strap Card** - in the ordered artwork items listed in the gallery straps located in Your Galleries page
  - e. **Artwork Gallery Card** - in the ordered artwork items listed in the gallery pages
  - When creating a gallery from an Artwork Card, the artwork the menu was located in is offered to be saved in the created gallery. Single **atomic transaction** (create gallery + add artwork); rollback gallery if add fails.
- **_Create a Gallery CTAs:_**
  - Found at the top of the page in Your Galleries, Gallery and Your Art Vault pages
  - It creates an empty gallery
